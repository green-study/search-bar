## Getting Started with Blockly

### What is Blockly?

Learn the foundations of coding with drag-and-drop blocks in our visual programming language. This is an excellent starting place for beginner programmers and drone pilots. The types of blocks are divided into junior blocks and senior blocks according to the difficulty level.  

Junior blocks are written with "natural language" and Senior blocks introduce programming syntax. Senior blocks introduce more advanced concepts and prepare students to transition into text-based programming. You can mix Junior and Senior blocks in your programs.

### How to Access Blockly

Blockly is an online application that you can access right from Google Chrome. With Blockly, you can connect it to your drone since Blockly runs from your browser&mdash;no need for any installation!

### Link to Blockly
Start programming your drone with Blockly by heading to <a href="https://codrone.robolink.com/edu/blockly/" target="_blank">codrone.robolink.com/edu/blockly</a>! After going to the provided link for Blockly, click on the CoDrone EDU icon to open a workspace for CoDrone EDU programming.

Try to use the cable that comes with CoDrone EDU whenever possible! This USB cable can transfer data, which is necessary for programming. Most USB cables now are data compatible. If your drone does not switch to LINK state when connecting, you may have the wrong cable or it may be broken.

### Google Chrome Requirements

Your Google Chrome should be updated to the most recent version. If you are not sure how to check, click on the the menu on the top right, scroll down to “Help”, and select “About Google Chrome”. Google Chrome might automatically update. If not, please update Chrome.
