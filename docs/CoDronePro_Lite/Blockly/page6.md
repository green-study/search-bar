### Minimum System Requirements
- Chrome browser version 56 or later

- MacBook, PC, or Chromebook. No iPads or Android tablets.

- Hardware that supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is different from Bluetooth Classic

- For MacBooks, that means MacBooks from 2012 or newer. Older MacBooks only have Bluetooth Classic, but no BLE support.

- For Windows machines, Windows 10, version 1703 or newer (Apr 5, 2017 update). Older Windows versions don't support BLE. Check your Device Manager to see if your computer has BLE installed.

- We've noticed issues specifically with the Bluetooth driver becoming disabled on these models after about 45 minutes of use: Acer Aspire 3 &ndash; A315-21, Acer Aspire 1 &ndash; A114-31, Acer Aspire 3 &ndash; A315-41, which can be temporarily fixed by re-installing the driver, though this isn't an ideal user experience. This seems to be a known Bluetooth issue on some Windows machines.

- We have noticed pairing issues specifically with some Windows desktops. If you're experiencing issues pairing, try using another device if that is an available option.
