<h3>21. MUTUAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT: BINDING ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</h3>

**a. Dispute Resolution**

Certain portions of this Section are deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"). You and Robolink expressly agree and intend that this Section satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.  This Section can only be amended by mutual agreement.  For purposes of this Section, "Claims" means collectively, without limitation, any and all claims, injuries, demands, liabilities, disputes, causes of action (including statutory, contract, negligence, or other tort theories), proceedings, obligations, debts, liens, fines, charges, penalties, contracts, promises, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees, whether incurred pre-litigation, pre-trial, at trial, on appeal, or otherwise), damages of any kind whatsoever (including consequential, compensatory, or punitive damages), or losses (whether known, unknown, asserted, non-asserted, fixed, conditional, or contingent) that arise from or relate to:  (i) the Site(s), including any and all contents, materials and software related thereto, and/or (ii) your use of the Site(s).

**b. Informal Resolution of Disputes and Excluded Disputes.**  

If any Claim arises out of or relates to the Site(s) or these Terms, other than as may be provided herein, then you and Robolink agree to send notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Claim, along with a proposed resolution of it. Robolink’s notice will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information you provided Robolink. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, Robolink has no obligation under this Section. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, you and Robolink will engage in a dialog to attempt to resolve the Claim, though nothing will require either you or Robolink to resolve the Claim on terms with respect to which you and Robolink, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.

**c. Binding Arbitration.** 

If you and Robolink cannot resolve a Claim, within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the notice, then you agree that any such Claim and all other disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration relating to your use of the Site(s), will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. The FAA, not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of such disputes, including the class action waiver below. However, you and Robolink agree that California state law or United States federal law shall apply to and govern, as appropriate, any and all Claims or disputes arising between you and Robolink regarding these Terms and the Site(s), whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to choice of law principles. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  However, an arbitrator must follow the terms of these Terms as a court would. THIS SECTION, INCLUDING THE PROVISIONS ON BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT OR THE PLATFORM.

**i.  Initiating Arbitration.**  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Robolink at 5075 Shoreham Pl, Ste 110 San Diego, CA 92122. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.  Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by JAMS’s rules.  The arbitration shall take place in San Jose, California or at such other venue (and pursuant to such procedures) mutually agreed upon. You can obtain JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:  JAMS: 800.352.5267 and [http://www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com).

**ii.  Arbitration Fees.**  You and Robolink will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.  If applicable arbitration rules or laws require Robolink to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section to be enforceable, then Robolink will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.  Arbitration rules may permit you to recover attorneys’ fees. Robolink will not seek to recover attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.

**iii.  Class Action Waiver.  YOU AND ROBOLINK EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. YOU AND ROBOLINK EACH AGREE THAT SUCH PROCEEDING SHALL TAKE SOLELY BY MEANS OF JUDICIAL REFERENCE PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 638.**

**iv.  Exclusions, Venue.**  Notwithstanding the agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, you or Robolink may sue in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (including patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and moral rights, but not including privacy rights).  You or Robolink may also seek relief in small claims court for Claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.  In the event the arbitration provisions above are found not to apply to you or to a particular Claim, either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the arbitration provisions or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree the venue for any such Claim or dispute is exclusively that of a state or federal court located in Santa Clara County, California.  You and Robolink agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara County, California for the purpose of litigating all such Claims or any other disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms or your use of the Site(s) in the event the arbitration provisions are found not to apply.  In such a case, should Robolink prevail in litigation against you to enforce its rights under the Terms, Robolink shall be entitled to its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees (whether incurred at or in preparation for trial, appeal or otherwise) incurred in resolving or settling the dispute, in addition to all other damages or awards to which Robolink may be entitled.

**v.
