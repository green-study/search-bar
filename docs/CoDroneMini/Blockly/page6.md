### Minimum System Requirements
- Chrome Browser version 80 or later

- MacBook, PC, or Chromebook. No iPads or Android tablets.

- Windows 10 or newer for PC users

- We have found a known issue where **macOS Catalina** sometimes has issues communicating with the Mac laptopâ€™s USB port. Updating to **macOS Big Sur** seems to fix this issue.

- Chrome browser flag "#enable-experimental-web-platform-features" enabled, which can be reached at URL "chrome://flags" in the Chrome Browser

- We have noticed pairing issues specifically with the **Samsung PEN NT950QAA-X716A** laptop running **Windows 10 Home** where Blockly cannot pair

- We have noticed pairing issues specifically with some Windows desktops. If you're experiencing issues pairing, try using another device if that is an available option.

If you meet these minimum system requirements, you can start using <a target="_blank" href="https://codrone.robolink.com/mini/blockly/">Blockly</a>!
