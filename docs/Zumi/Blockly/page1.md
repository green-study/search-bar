## What is Blockly?

Learn the foundations of coding with drag-and-drop blocks in our visual programming language. This is an excellent starting place for beginner programmers and drone pilots.

Blockly is a block coding program from Robolink based on python. The types of blocks are divided into junior blocks and senior blocks according to the difficulty level.  

Junior blocks have these things: (CoDrone EDU blocks) Flight Commands, Flight Sequences, Status Checkers, Lights, Sounds, (Programming blocks) Events, Input/Output, Logic, Loops, Math, Timing, Variables, Lists. 

Senior blocks have these things: (CoDrone EDU blocks) Flight Commands, Flight Variables, Status Checkers, Sensors, Lights, Sounds, Screen, Colors, (Programming blocks) Events, Input/Output, Logic, Loops, Math, Timing, Variables, Functions, Lists.

Try to use the cable that comes with CoDrone EDU whenever possible! This Micro USB cable can transfer data, which is necessary for programming. Most Micro USB cables now are data compatible. If your drone does not switch to LINK state when connecting, you may have the wrong cable or it may be broken.
